ALU: 1) all non blocking assignments 
     2) Sub and SUbu same and no checking of greater or lesser 
     3) Change of SLT W from 1 to 32'd1 
     4) SRA BUS B >> BUS A to BUS A >> BUS B 
     5) BusB<<16 to {BusB[15:0],16'd0}
     6) All non blocking 

ALU Control:
     1) all non blocking 

DATA Memory: 
     1) Removed wire tag from input 
     2)reg [31:0] MEMO[0:255] to reg [7:0] MEMO[128:0] and thus change the read and storing of data 
     3) address as 31 bits
     4) used blocking instead of non blocking 

Instruction Memory:
Same as given by user no changes 

PC: no change, though there are some differences 

Register file: remove intial statements, others seem correct. 

sign exten: not used, check it out later 

Single_cycle_control: 
     
1) Rtype: RegWrite changed from 0 to 1 
2) sw type: memtoreg changed form 0 to 1 but ideally it should be x 
3) Jump sign extension changed to 1  but ideally it should be x
4) check out why ori sign extension should be 0 
5) ALU source 1 for xori 
6) All delays removed. 
7) control not added properly.
